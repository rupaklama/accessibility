    <!-- Bypass blocks are mechanisms that skip over repeated material on a webpage. 
    They are important for users who navigate with a keyboard because as they will 
    allow users to skip over repeated sections and go to the content they are looking for immediately. -->
    <!-- It's like going through all the tabindex to get to the particular location on a web page -->

    <!-- NOTE:  Bypass Blocks are often use on TOP of the site, however, 
      if you have lots of repeated content, it might be a good idea to put in the middle of the site as well
      if needed -->
