  <!-- ARIA - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of attributes 
    that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) 
    more accessible to people with disabilities. -->
  
    <!-- ARIA attributes always start with 
        aria-label: 'aria' prefix, '-' after & ACTION that you want attribute to take
        This will label the current element with custom text. 
    -->

    <!-- screen reader will read aria-expanded="true" when menu opens up,
      this effect can only be done using aria attributes
    -->
    <button aria-expanded="false">&#9776;</button>

    <!-- aria-label: Defines a string value that labels the current element.  -->
    <!-- screen readers will announce it -->
    <a href="#" aria-label="google.com">google</a>

    <!-- aria-labelledby: Identifies the element (or elements) that labels the current element -->
    <!-- screen readers will announce 'Title' in paragraph for the image -->
    <!-- Screen reader will first read 'alt attrib', so if it's empty then will read 'file name' - not good -->
    <img src="" alt="" aria-labelledby="caption">
    <p id="caption">random picture</p>

    <!-- ARIA attribute - NOTE: ROLE doesn't have aria prefix -->
    <!-- If force to use Un-semantic element, use ROLE attribute to make behave as a different element like button 
        to be as a Semantic element. 
    -->
    <!-- Whenever screen readers read the image, it will announce it as 'button' -->
    <!-- The tabindex attribute specifies the tab order of an element (when the "tab" button is used for navigating). -->
    <!-- tabindex="0" - is going to make an element FOCUSABLE. Inserts an element into the natural tab order. 
       The element can be focused by pressing the Tab key, and the element can be focused by calling its focus() method
       tabindex="5": Any tabindex greater than 0 jumps the element to the front of the natural tab order
     -->
