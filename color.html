    <!-- Colors accessible usually means creating color combinations that provide enough contrast(color-difference) 
    that the content is clearly distinguishable from the surrounding page. -->

    <!-- Designers use 'Grayscale' to design Accessible mockups for website because
    if your website looks good in Grayscale, chances are it's going to look good for 'Color Blind' people as well -->
