    <!-- One of the most important things in achieving in Web Accessibility is using Semantic html. 
      
      Semantic elements (Meaningful HTML Elements) = elements with a meaning.
      
      A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

      Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

      Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
        <article>
        <aside>
        <details>
        <figcaption>
        <figure>
        <footer>
        <header>
  -->
    <!-- hamburger menu icon- always change anchor tag to button -->
    <!-- <a>&#9776;</a> -->
    <button>&#9776;</button>
    <br>

    <!-- If force to use Un-semantic element, use ROLE attribute to make behave as a different element like button 
        to be as a Semantic element. 
    -->
    <!-- This will make anchor element to behave as a BUTTON element -->

    <!-- The tabindex attribute specifies the tab order of an element (when the "tab" button is used for navigating). -->
    <!-- tabindex="0" - is going to make an element FOCUSABLE. 
       Inserts an element into the natural tab order. 
       The element can be focused by pressing the Tab key, and the element can be focused by calling its focus() method
       tabindex="5": Any tabindex greater than 0 jumps the element to the front of the natural tab order
     -->

     <!-- in the case of no 'href link' in a tag, avoid this & try to use sematic element - button -->
     <a role="button" tabindex="0">&#9776;</a> 
   

  </body>
