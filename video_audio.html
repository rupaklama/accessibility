      Providing captions and transcripts to videos and podcasts (or any type of
      audio you might have) not only shows compassion and makes the day of a
      disabled person better, but also enables search engines to index the
      contents of your media. Search bots can't play videos or podcasts.
    </p>

      Providing captions and transcript First step is to get captions. You can
      either do it yourself or hire someone, either a freelancer or a company.
      You send them the video (or just a link where it is hosted) and they will
      start working. Make sure you ask for a transcript as well, as it will
      often be included in the price, since the difference between a caption and
      a transcript is the timed sentences. Another option is computer generated
      captions, but they are unreliable. I am sure you have clicked the YouTube
      ones, and they are often either incomprehensible or just plain wrong. Not
      to mention they don't include audio descriptions like "sneezes" or
      "whispering". And if the speaker has an accent like me, it's a lost cause
      trying to get good generated captions. There are two types of captions -
      open and closed. Open captioning is when they are "baked" into the video
      so you can't edit them, nor turn them off. The benefit of those is that
      you don't need a player to support captioning to run them and they appear
      right away, with no fussing over to enable them. You can offer them in
      multiple languages, but you are limited by the space since all languages
      must appear at the same time - on the other hand, it is useful for
      language learning videos. You can't edit the captions if a mistake has
      been made or add many translations. They will also be very much in the way
      if you are viewing the video on a narrow viewport. Unlike open captioning,
      with closed ones you can turn them on and off, you can offer them in
      multiple languages and you can edit them any time. On the downside, you
      need a player that supports them and the toggle needs to be easy to find.
      I prefer to have closed captions since I like their flexibility, and I
      have them turned on by default. That way if a user needs them, they are
      right there without needing to search for the button to enable them. I
      also indicate that the video has captions in the title, for example "About
      Stefany Newman [Closed Captions]".

      If your site is multi-lingual you should provide transcript and captions
      in the offered languages. Quality captions include: Correct grammar &
      punctuation All on-screen text, e.g. if the speaker is showing something
      written in a book or a sign and doesn't say it Audio description e.g.
      "chimes", "monitor beeping erratically", "door hisses open" Placement that
      doesn't block important things on the screen (e.g. the speaker's face) For
      live broadcasts, live captioning should be provided. The House of
      Representatives require live captioning contractors to capture accurately
      98.6% of all that's being said live. There are also various companies that
      provide live captioning to events. If you are hosting a conference, you
      should provide live captioning so that deaf / hard of hearing people will
      be able to enjoy it and it will also help people with ADHD. As for
      transcripts, you can either include them in the same document as the video
      or in a different page. They follow roughly the same rules as the
      captions, and if you want to go the extra mile, you can make them
      interactive. An interactive transcript allows your to click on timestamps
      and it jumps through the video or you click on the text and it leaps at
      the beginning of the sentence. Even better, if they player supports it,
      you can have a box that shows the text that is being outlined live.
      However, just providing a plain text transcript is enough for
      accessibility.

      Audio / Visual Description Audio description is a voice that describes
      what is happening in the video. According to the The Audio Description
      Project "It is a narration service [..] that attempts to describe what the
      sighted person takes for granted -- those images that a person who is
      blind or visually impaired formerly could only experience through the
      whispered asides from a sighted companion " W3CWAI.org's video on
      accessibility has an audio description. The video and the player is an
      excellent example of media accessibility done right. I invite you to click
      around and explore it. Audio description is crucial if you have a video
      with no dialogue. If you can't provide one, make sure the transcript
      and/or the captions are descriptive. If you fail to even do that, you have
      prevented access to your video to roughly 285 million blind people
      worldwide. Same goes for presentations. If you have a presentation with
      charts and diagrams, anything that you assume a sighted person will take
      for granted, add an audio description, or, even better, try to make your
      presentation as accessible as possible. For example, if you are showing a
      chart that shows direct marketing revenue skyrocketing in comparison to
      last year, you might be tempted to say "According the chart, if we double
      the amount of brochures we send, we will get more profits" but instead say
      "Direct marketing profits are 59% higher than last year's 43%" My rule of
      thumb is, anytime I am lecturing and I am tempted to say the words "as you
      can see" means I must change the way I say it. The above technique is also
      known as "Integrated Described Video" or IDV. If done correctly, it
      eliminates the need for a separate audio track and it improves the
      inclusivity of your video in a way that families and friends could enjoy
      your media together, regardless of their abilities.

      Providing sign language translation Sign language isn't universal nor is
      it "English on the hands". If you want to add a picture-in-picture sign
      language translation to your videos, you need to know your audience. There
      are roughly three hundred sign languages in the world, so you have to
      figure out which nationality will your visitors be which can be daunting.
      If you have an e-commerce site and you are shipping only to USA and
      Canada, you only need ASL(American Sign Language) and Langue des Signes
      Québécoise (LSQ) translation. However, if you live and ship in Quebec,
      just the latter will suffice. So delve into your site analytics and
      determine the best way to serve your visitors. You can provide
      picture-in-picture sign language translation by getting the interpreter's
      recording and embedding it into the video with a video editing program.
      Make sure that the media player supports full screen, otherwise the box of
      the translator might be too small and deaf / hard of hearing people won't
      be able to see it. You can also provide side-by-side videos of both the
      original recording and the interpreter one.

      Accessible Podcasts Interactive transcripts are great for podcasts. At the
      very least, a timetable with a full transcript should be provided. As
      mentioned above, a video with a sign language translator will be great.
      Remember, deaf / hard of hearing people can read just fine, but it will be
      even better experience to watch a sign language translation. If the
      podcast is especially long, they'd have to spend a long time reading. Make
      sure you conduct your podcasts in an accessible way. Speak at a normal
      rate and narrate all things that are important like chart data or
      statistics. Unlike a video, there is no visual aid for sighted users and
      if you create a podcast with accessibility in mind, it will be even better
      for everyone. Not all of your listeners will know your spoken language as
      their native and it will help immensely people with cognitive
      disabilities. Make sure to list the speakers and all links mentioned in
      the podcast. It not only helps accessibility, but it ranks your podcast
      better in Google since it can be indexed. Some visitors might be unable to
      listen to your podcast at the moment (for example if they are on a train
      or in the library and have forgotten their headphones) but they could read
      the transcript. Other people prefer learning and consuming information by
      reading rather than listening. As with captions, if your site is
      multi-lingual or a big chunk of your audience's native language is other
      than your main one, you should also get your transcript translated. I
      suggest you playback your recordings and search for things you could have
      done better. I know it can be awkward and time consuming, but it will make
      you a better lecturer. For example, I noticed I tend to speak very fast
      when talking about a subject I am passionate about, so I have taken steps
      to speak at a normal rate.

    <p>Avoid harming your audience
      Flashy video or animation can harm your visitors if they are suffering from photosensitive epilepsy. It's one of the many reasons why you should never autoplay videos. Before you add a video, watch it and if you are doubting the content is seizure inducing, try consulting with a medical professional. If you must absolutely display such a video, add a warning and don't autoplay it.
      
      Seizure inducing media can even harm people without epilepsy. Children are especially vulnerable. In 1997, a single episode of Pokemon triggered a seizure of over 700 kids and some adults. The serie had red and blue lights flashing for a few seconds, both things that trigger seizures. Imagine something like that autoplaying as a hero video on a website!
      
      Be also careful of auto-playing carousels. While you should avoid adding a carousel  on a website altogether, nowadays fancy and flashy animations are very popular with slideshows.This poses serious risk of inducing seizures or at the very least, migraines.
      
      CSS animations can be even more dangerous because they always autoplay and can't be paused, so you can't even add warnings.
      
      CSS animations have become very popular recently and while they can be helpful, if done poorly they can have the same negative effect. Always check if your animation will be a seizure trigger. After all, one animation send over 700 people to the hospital.
      
      
      
      Accessible video / audio   player
      You can have the perfect captions and transcript but if the media player doesn't support it, they will be useless. Features of accessible playback software include:
      
      Displaying captions
      
      Button for audio descriptions
      
      Full screen option
      
      Keyboard accessible
      
      As Cross Browser Compatible as possible (toss it if it doesn't run on the most popular browsers)
      
      Support for interactive transcript
      
      OzPlayer is a good example of accessible media player. If your organization is using a custom media player, check whether it is accessible. Your customized solution might be doing you a great disservice!
      
      For motor impaired users, controlling the player without a mouse is vital. Check the keyboard accessibility of the player by using it to control the various options (play, pause, full screen) and pay close attention to the outline contrast. You might not be able to edit the outlines if you are invoking the video via <iframe> so try to use a player if contrast is an issue. YouTube allows you to embed your video in numerous players, and with Vimeo you need a PRO subscription (I wish Vimeo changes it to allow the users to customize the outlines for accessibility).

      <p>Putting it all together
        Captions, transcript, audio description, non-seizure/migraine inducing content, keyboard functions, accessible player - it all ties together to create an incredible experience for abled and disabled users. But all the inventions in the world are useless without the ultimate ingredient - desire. A desire to share your content and to make it in a way as many people as possible will be able to enjoy. Not only will you reap enormous benefits, but you will get the best gain ever - making the world a better place.
